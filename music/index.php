      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
      The music industry has been fighting copyright violations since the birth of the Internet, but
      with the latest technologies that enable transparent decentralized ledgers it is now possible 
      for artists to sell shares in the their songs rather than copies of their songs.  
      </p>
      <p>
      The advantage of selling shares in your songs is that their value is attached to the
      popularity.  Fans have incentivie to buy shares and then share the song to increase its
      popularity.   This changes the incentives on its head and allows young bands to crowd fund
      the money they need to make it big.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is already one team working on making this a reality.  More information will be available soon.
