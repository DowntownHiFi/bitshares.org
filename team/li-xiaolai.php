  <center><h1>LI XIAOLAI</h1></center>
  <center><h3>Founder</h3></center>
<p>
Li Xiaolai (pictured above), was a speaker at the event I attended at Cheku Café. He is perhaps the most famous figure in the Chinese Bitcoin world. Li admitted on one occasion that his Bitcoin holding is the six digits. At the current exchange rate, that is more USD 50 million, but such comparison may not do Bitcoin justice as unlike 50 million dollars, 100,000 Bitcoins is about 1/100 of all existing Bitcoins. The world’s most famous Bitcoin millionaires are Winklevoss twins who own 120,000 Bitcoins.

Li, 41, studied accounting at college. Following graduation he worked as a salesman, and later as an English teacher. Li said on one occasion that English teaching is really just a type of sales in China: with millions of young Chinese aspiring to go abroad, English teaching is essentially selling a dream. Li also published several books such as “Breakthrough on TOEFL essential vocabulary in 21 days”, “How to get high scores in TOEFL essay”. But he did not make much money from these endeavors.

In the first two years after the first Bitcoins were minted in 2009, the virtual currency were used among geeks and worth no more than a few cents. Few people knew about them. Stories of a man spending 10,000 Bitcoins to buy a pizza and of a hacker attack that sent the price down by half began to interest the news media and global interest in the currency grew.

Li recounted his roller roaster trip starting from the year when his employer, the testing cramming school operator New Oriental, went public. As a new employee, Li was allowed to buy a small number of pre-IPO shares. While the company was well received at the New York Exchange, many of Li’s colleagues had fears that the company was overvalued and did not have a bright future, which Li described as “insider’s pessimism”. Li decided he wanted to invest his money elsewhere, and this was when he found out about Bitcoin.

Li described the moment when he learned the article as a moment of shock. The idea was so elegant and Li was so mesmerized that he wasted no time to find the paper by Satoshi Nakamoto on the Internet. Although he couldn’t understand it completely, it didn’t prevent him from selling all his shares and loading up with Bitcoins. He was convinced that this thing was going to be big. In days to follow, Li said he had many insomniac nights. But as his Bitcoins grew in value, he decided to expand his profits by investing in a container worth of computers for mining.
