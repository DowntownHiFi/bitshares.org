      <h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
      <p>
      The idea of having contracts that automatically execute a set of predefined rules when 
      certain conditions have been met has been around for a long time.  Until Bitcoin
      came abount with its transparent ledger, smart contracts lacked any binding authority
      on the decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are many active projects that attempt to go beyond Bitcoins limited validation
      transaction language to offer full featured scripting languages with access to far more
      data upon which it may make decisions.

      <h3>Ethereum</h3>
      <p>
      Ethereum is a new project that has gained a lot of attention. 
      It can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything: voting, domain names, financial exchanges, crowdfunding, company governance, contracts and agreements of most kind, intellectual property, and even smart property thanks to hardware integration.

      <h3>Bitshares</h3>
      <p>
      There exists an opporuntity to apply the ideas of
      Decentralized Autonomous Companies to the smart contract ideas
      being discussed by Ethereum &amp; Nxt to produce a more effecient
      and profitable solution in this space.  We are looking for
      someone who would like to take on the challenge of combining
      the best the industry has to offer.
