        <h3>No more seizures</h3>
        <p>
            With traditional DNS, the registrars lease you your name and can take back your ownership at any time. With .p2p, nobody can update your DNS record unless you share your private keys.

        <h3>No more spying</h3>
        <p>
            With blockchain technology, you don't need certificate authorities. Finally you can trust self-signed certificates to let your visitors connect securely without fear of spying.

        <h3>No more snake oil</h3>
        <p>
            With .p2p, renewals and other updates to your DNS record all cost a standard transaction fee. Stop getting milked for the right to manage your domain.

        <h3>Efficient Security</h3>
        <p>
            The share supply is never diluted to pay for security and no power is ever spent for POW mining. DPOS gives control of the blockchain back to the stakeholders.

        <h3>Price Fixing vs Price Discovery</h3>
        <p>
            By utilizing a mechanic similar to an auction, .p2p domains are sold for their perceived market price and the majority of the income from the sale go to nameshare holders as profit.

        <h3>Eliminate Squatters</h3>
        <p>
            Domain name squatting is a social dillemma that is fixed by giving a mechanism to speculate on the value of the namespace (dividends from nameshares) without having to buy names en masse.
