            AGS (Angel Shares) are shares in an angel fund that supports the research, development and creation of the BitShares technology. Those who support the fund are given public credit as 10,000 AGS shares are awarded each day, proportional to the amount donated. AGS donations started on January 1, 2014, are not liquid, and are limited to 2 million shares.

            AGS can be thought of as an imaginary altcoin with an extraordinary source of value. People who hold them get free shares 
            in every new <span style="color:#9ce936;">bit</span><span style="color:#009df6;">shares</span> decentralized autonomous company.
            </p>

            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>
            The only way you can possibly get AGS is to be a Patron Angel. 
            You donated funds to help build and promote the <span style="color:#9ce936;">bit</span><span style="color:#009df6;">shares</span> industry. People just don’t do that kind of thing without understanding the industry, and wanting to see it grow, and actually sacrificing to help it grow because they value shares in this industry and want to own more.
            </p>
            <p>
               <center><b>DAC Developers Know This</b></center>
            </p>
            <p>
            They know if they give you promotional shares, you won’t dump them.
            You’ll take take a hard look at their business potential.
            And you’ll probably buy or donate more – pushing up the value of their shares
            And you’ll probably talk about them everywhere you go. 
            </p>
            <h3>How to become a Patron Angel</h3>
            <p>
            <span style="color:#9ce936;">bit</span><span style="color:#009df6;">shares</span> AGS is a public way to document who has donated to help build the industry. 
            Donations are used to help build software tools and a powerful ecosystem to help developers launch their new digital autonomous companies. It return, 3rd party 
            developers may choose to give shares in their new companies as “tips” to those donors.  They do this primarily as a targeted promotion to attract the support 
            of people who are likely to contribute to their new ventures in a variety of helpful ways.  Proven donors are Very Important Persons!

               All BTC and PTS donations are put in a trust that will use funds in a manner that it feels will grow the <span style="color:#9ce936;">bit</span><span style="color:#009df6;">shares</span> industry and secure the right to life, liberty and property for all mankind.  A public transaction ledger that outlines how we are allocating the funds given to the trust will be maintained.

You should only give if you believe this is a good cause and you trust us to use the funds wisely.

               Gifts are not tax deductable and the <span style="color:#9ce936;">bit</span><span style="color:#009df6;">shares</span> trust is not a registered non-profit organization.

              <span style="color:#9ce936;">bit</span><span style="color:#009df6;">shares</span> PTS is a Bitcoin clone that allows you to mine and trade your support for the <span style="color:#9ce936;">bit</span><span style="color:#009df6;">shares</span> ecosystem.  You become a
              member of a larger community of individuals who believe in building decentralized technology when you own even a fraction of
              a PTS.

              <p>
              <span style="color:#9ce936;">bit</span><span style="color:#009df6;">shares</span> PTS comes with a social consensus that at least 10% of the total shares in all future
              <span style="color:#9ce936;">bit</span><span style="color:#009df6;">shares</span> blockchains should acknowledge the support given by the holders of PTS by providing an initial balance
              in the genesis block of each new chain.  In the case of <a href="bitshares/x.php">bitshares X</a>
              we recommend that supporters be acknowledged with 50% of the total shares in the genesis block.
              </p>
              <p>
              We only recommend that those who choose to take our software and launch a bitshares blockchain recognize our supporters who made this possible.

                    <h3> Mining Pools</h3>

                      <p>Mining PTS on your own is hard. The network consists of many computers running calculations in the client software or special mining software. This keeps the network secure.
                      But you can mine coins with your own processing power or cloud servers. The pool combines the power of all
                      connected nodes and pays you proportionally for your share rate. Most pools have their own optimized miners, so do check out their "get started" pages.</p>

                      <p>This is a list of pools mining PTS:</p>

              <h3> Exchanges</h3>

                      <p>Exchanges are the trading websites where you can buy or sell PTS. Be careful not to place large sums of PTS on exchanges without adequate security measures, such as a good password and 2-factor authentication.</p>
                      <p>If you hold PTS in an exchange rather than a wallet for which you control the Private Key, then those who launch new BitShares blockchains will be unable to recognize your support of the ecosystem. </p>
