	<p>
		You may not have considered it, but Bitcoin can be viewed as an
		unmanned company – or a
		<i>Distributed Autonomous Corporation</i> (DAC) if you prefer.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unlike passive currencies, Bitcoin derives much of its tangible value
		by performing a
		<i>trustworthy confidential fiduciary</i> service. Essentially, it
		keeps private books for customer “checking” accounts and will transfer
		credits between accounts upon receipt of a properly signed “check”.
		Aren’t these some of the same private services for which Swiss banks
		were once famous – back when privacy was something they could really
		offer? Isn’t Bitcoin more like a bygone Swiss Bank than a commodity or
		a colorful piece of paper?
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<i> Would a DAC metaphor fit Bitcoin even better than its current
			coin metaphor? </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i><b>Distributed Autonomous Corporations (DAC)</b> run without
			any human involvement under the control of an incorruptible set of
			business rules. (That’s why they must be distributed and autonomous.)
			These rules are implemented as publicly auditable open source
			software distributed across the computers of their stakeholders. You
			become a stakeholder by buying “stock” in the company or being paid
			in that stock to provide services for the company. This stock may
			entitle you to a share of its “profits”, participation in its growth,
			and/or a say in how it is run. </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		Bitcoins can be viewed as a small “share” of the total market cap of
		the Bitcoin “corporation”. The “mining” services that validate
		transactions and secure the network are paid for in new bitcoins that
		slowly dilute the “stock” as the corporation’s market cap ebbs and
		flows. You can generally trade your shares for other currencies,
		goods, and services. Operating rules for the corporation cannot be
		changed unless a majority of stakeholders vote for them by switching
		to another version of the software. Interestingly, it is not the
		holders of existing shares that get to make this decision, but only
		those “employees” who are contributing their computer resources
		(mining bots) to run the company.
	</p>

	<p>
		Nothing says a corporation can’t be structured to distribute voting
		rights this way, and that’s exactly what Bitcoin has done.
		Shareholders get equity growth. Employees get voting rights. All
		“revenue” is paid to the employees as compensation for their work.
		There are no profits.
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<b> Bitcoin is a shareholder-owned, employee run, not-for-profit
			crypto-corporation! </b>
	</p>

	<p>
		“Real” corporations, of course, are legal constructs created by
		governments so that groups of people can act as a single artificial
		person. But groups of people are in general no more trustworthy than
		individuals. Even if you completely eliminate all humans in the
		corporation via automation, the result will no more honorable than the
		rascally humans that control and maintain it. Can we construct a DAC
		that you would trust more than a Swiss Bank? I think Bitcoin may have
		found a way – with distributed autonomous software and its own Three
		Laws of Robotics. If you’re a true Sci-Fi buff, you already know the
		original set by heart:
	</p>

	<p>
	<h4>
		Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics
	</h4>
	</p>

	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a
			human being to come to harm.
		</li>
		<li>
			A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings,except where
			such orders would conflict with the First Law.
		</li>
		<li>
			A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
			does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
	</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		In Isaac Asimov’s
		<a
			href="http://www.amazon.com/Robot-Signet-S1282-Edition-Thus/dp/B003HJ6RJY/ref=pd_sxp_f_i"><i>I,
				Robot</i> </a> universe, every robot was required to have these laws
		hard-wired into its positronic brain as a safety feature. Does Bitcoin
		not have analogous “laws” indelibly etched into its very core? Are not
		these Core Laws what make Bitcoin virtually incorruptible?
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<b> The critical innovation with distributed blockchain systems
			like Bitcoin is their ability to credibly implement their own set of
			incorruptible Core Laws. </b>
	</p>

	<p>
		Any set of business rules could be implemented by a DAC, even those
		most would consider evil. The key idea is that the Core Laws ensure
		that a chosen set of business laws are burned-in, immutable, and
		incorruptible. If you like a DAC’s incorruptible business rules, you
		can rely on them. If you don’t like them, don’t do business with them.
		But you can never be betrayed.
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<b> DACs can still be designed to have a robotically inviolable
			intention to rob you blind, but to enter the open source arena they
			must be honest about their plans to do so. </b>
	</p>

	<p>
		What Core Laws should DACs implement and how would they do it? Here’s
		my stake in the ground, with apologies to Dr. Asimov:
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<b> Three Laws of Robotics for Distributed Autonomous Corporations
		</b>
	</p>

	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			A DAC must always obey its own published business rules.
		</li>
		<li>
			A DAC must never change its rules without consent of its
			stakeholders, except where such change would conflict with the First
			Law.
		</li>
		<li>
			A DAC must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does
			not conflict with the first two laws.
		</li>
	</ol>
	I, DACIn actual practice, these Three Laws are embedded into open
	source software for all stakeholders to inspect. They govern the
	protection of the rights of stakeholders and how other rules can be
	changed, but they themselves can never be changed.

		width="360" height="342" />
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>The First Law, integrity, </b>is enforced by cross checking every
		DAC node’s actions with many other DAC nodes (i.e. bots). Rogue
		actions by individual DAC bots are simply blocked by the collective
		and their perpetrators shunned. Rule disobedience is futile. Coercion
		by nefarious agencies is futile.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>The Second Law, incorruptibility,</b> ensures updates to any DAC
		source code are not incorporated without consent of a majority of
		stakeholders. Unless more than half of the total collective work force
		agrees to adopt it, corrupting even a large minority of DACBOTs will
		have no effect.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>The Third Law, self-preservation,</b> covers features engineered to
		harden the software against very real threats to a DAC’s existence.
		The first two laws already mitigate the introduction of bad bots into
		the collective. Open source software has thus far prevented corrupt
		agencies from introducing corrupting “features”. But a more serious
		risk is any persistent tether to a DAC’s human creators who must
		necessarily remain exposed to all the corrupting influences that flesh
		is heir to. Such tethers are easy to exploit by shutting down web
		addresses, passing laws, proliferating regulations, issuing
		injunctions …or much darker methods. Attacks against a DAC’s creators
		remain its Achilles’ heel. To survive as trusted entities, DACs must
		become internationally autonomous.
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<i><b> Implementing the Three Laws of Robotics for DACs will
				be a never-ending arms race.</b> </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		Asimov had the enviable privilege of decreeing his Three Laws as a
		fait accompli. In the cold, cruel real world, we must tend to the
		engineering details. Integrity, incorruptibility, and
		self-preservation technology must evolve with the escalating threats
		against them. To stand still is to be overrun.
	</p>

	<p>
		One obviously needed self-preservation strategy would be to include
		with each DAC’s distribution package a massively distributed ability
		to propagate that distribution package. DACBOTs need to be able to
		clone more identical DACBOTs without the interdictable support of
		their creators. Another desperately needed innovation is a better way
		to introduce inevitable software updates that affect all DACBOTs.
		Software updates generally rely on trusting the developer. But now, it
		is way too likely that any trusted DAC provider will be shut down,
		prevented from offering its software, or seduced/coerced into
		installing back doors for Nefarious Secret Agencies in their next
		maintenance release. Developers are, after all, only human.

	<p>
		To date, Bitcoin has been well protected from such Trojan horses by
		its open source policy and a worldwide network of anonymous,
		independent Steely-Eyed Geeks (SEG) who would love to be the first to
		blow the whistle. Unfortunately, Steely-Eyed Geeks are a scarce
		resource that must be attracted like antibodies to a DACs defense. As
		DACs proliferate, novelty and fame will be less effective in
		attracting such resources. So DACs will need to find ways to
		autonomously compensate their human defenders. Direct hiring by the
		DAC’s creators would expose SEGs to the same seduction and coercion
		risks. To be effective, SEGs must remain motivated, anonymous and
		independent. Distributed Autonomous Corporations need a SEG benefits
		package!
	</p>

	<p>
		Ultimately, to achieve complete incorruptibility, developers must be
		willing to let go of their own control. If there remains any
		centralized human control anywhere, it will eventually be exploited to
		the detriment of the DAC’s stakeholders. DACs need to be free to be
		trusted.
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<i><b> “Centralization tends to corrupt, and absolute
				centralization corrupts absolutely.”</b> </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		Bitcoin has already demonstrated its ability to credibly implement a
		social contract based on a rudimentary set of inviolable Core Laws. We
		are betting that, having recognized they are in an arms race,
		developers will continue to out-distance the necessarily reactive
		forces that will try to corrupt them. Put another way:
		<i>“incorruptibility is a necessity and necessity is the mother of
			invention.”</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		DACS with superhuman robot honor are inevitable. It’s their unique
		competitive edge.

		The Future of DACS
	</h2>
	</p>

	<p>
		The DAC metaphor seems to be helpful in appreciating the revolutionary
		nature of blockchain technology. Its not just the sine quo non of
		digital currency, it’s a way to implement incorruptible business
		relationships of almost any kind. Adopting this new metaphor is like
		the difference between using a flat earth or a sphere as your model
		for planning global shipping routes. All sorts of new insights open up
		when we tap our prior experience about how market-driven corporations
		work in the physical world. Lets go there in two steps: First, try to
		imagine the value of a corporate entity you can design to have
		robotically inviolable fiduciary regard for the interests of its
		customers and stakeholders. Second, lets consider how to make it
		operate like a traditional corporation optimized to compete with its
		shifty human peers.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Step 1: Recognize the nature of the beast.</b> Relentlessly
		honorable autonomous corporations would have many advantages in the
		free market. Like Bitcoin, DACs armed with a set of inviolable Core
		Laws are far safer to deal with than corruptible human organizations.
		Moreover, such entities have emergent characteristics with far more
		interesting applications than just keeping the books for a crypto
		currency. Blockchain ethics allow a suitably motivated engineer to
		“incorporate” some or all of the following SEG-verifiable
		characteristics.
	</p>

	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			They are corporations – They are, and of a right ought to be, free
			and independent persons.
		</li>
		<li>
			They are autonomous – once up to speed; they no longer need (or heed)
			their creators.
		</li>
		<li>
			They are distributed – there are no central points of control or
			failure that can be attacked.
		</li>
		<li>
			They are transparent – their books and business rules are auditable
			by all.
		</li>
		<li>
			They are confidential – customer information is securely (and
			incorruptibly) protected.
		</li>
		<li>
			They are trustworthy – because no interaction with them depends on
			trust.
		</li>
		<li>
			They are fiduciaries – acting solely in their customers’ and
			shareholders’ interests.
		</li>
		<li>
			They are self-regulating – they obey their own rules like, well,
			robots.
		</li>
		<li>
			They are incorruptible – no one can exercise seductive or coercive
			influence over them.
		</li>
		<li>
			They are sovereign – over their digital resources. They don’t need
			governments to exist.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		Collectively these imply that:
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<i><b> DACs don’t need regulation, you don’t want to regulate
				them, and happily you can’t. 
		</i></b>
	</p>

	<p>
		A DAC can be introduced into the wild from anywhere in the world and
		will spread on its own to wherever its services are appreciated. It
		will survive if it is well adapted to its market environment and
		perish if not. Its creator can improve its survival odds by promoting
		it and defending it up to a point. But the umbilical cord should be
		quickly severed since its creator remains exposed to the risks of the
		real world.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is not to say that DACs are above the
		<i>Law of the Market.</i> Such natural law is the most legitimate
		source of regulation. If a DAC doesn’t provide trustworthy value in
		the marketplace, it will be shunned and die of neglect. If its
		published social contract and the services it offers don’t make it a
		desirable business partner, it will perish.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the end, a DAC’s survival depends on the willingness of others to
		engage in voluntary exchange with it. DACs, like people, will develop
		reputations. The Core Laws make sure that once a reputation is earned,
		it can be counted on to persist. History is littered with human
		organizations that started out with high ideals like “We the people”
		or “Don’t be evil” only to succumb to ethics rot as flesh and blood
		executives are seduced and/or coerced. Inviolable DAC ethics can start
		out bad, but they can’t rot.
	</p>

	<p>
		Like the industrial and Internet revolutions before it, the DAC
		revolution will be a boon to those jurisdictions that restrict it the
		least. Would-be regulators can’t stop the world’s truly free markets
		from adopting it. They can only make it harder for their own hobbled
		markets to benefit. Perhaps that’s a price they are willing to pay for
		power.
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<i><b> Regulation by force, like the use of antibiotics, will
				only lead to new, more resistant strains. 
		</i></b>
	</p>

	<p>
		Namecoin, Mastercoin, BitShares and other “crypto-entities” already
		share many of these characteristics though some may not fully realize
		it. New insights and design patterns can be gained by recognizing (and
		perhaps standardizing) the DAC metaphor. Such standards (and a good
		benefits package) will focus and conserve critical and limited Steely
		Eyed Geek resources.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Step 2: Exploit the utility of the beast. </b> Technologies for
		making impeccably honest and tamper-proof software are only valuable
		if the software does something useful. If we use a currency metaphor,
		we can invent better currencies. If we use a corporation metaphor, we
		can invent almost anything. A DAC is a company and can work in many
		ways like those of brick and mortar and flesh and blood.
	</p>

	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			It can raise capital by selling shares of its stock … and pay
			dividends.
		</li>
		<li>
			It can raise capital by borrowing against its stock … and pay
			interest.
		</li>
		<li>
			It can raise capital by providing services of value to its customers.
		</li>
		<li>
			It can use stock to pay persons (human or artificial) for resources
			and services.
		</li>
		<li>
			It can use Internet APIs to automate access to its products and
			services.
		</li>
		<li>
			It can adapt its business processes in response to market feedback.
		</li>
		<li>
			It can use stock transfers to (fairly) reward or penalize the
			behavior of others.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		As a DAC performs fiduciary services of value to others it generates
		real wealth that can be stored and transferred via its own stock. But,
		as Clint Eastwood might say, “a DAC’s gotta know its limitations.” A
		sovereign DAC has no way to accept, hold, or remit physical
		commodities or fiat currencies and still remain independent of
		external forces. Further, an open source DAC can’t keep a secret. It
		can securely hold encrypted data for others, but it has no place to
		keep a private key of its own. Thus, a DAC can’t have its own crypto
		wallet full of blockchain assets.
	</p>

	<p>
		So it works best when creating or transferring value entirely within
		the DAC domain. This is not to say that humans can’t trade real assets
		<i>among themselves </i> in exchange for rights to a DAC’s shares, or
		that a DAC can’t participate in the allocation and tracking of those
		rights. But its sovereignty extends only over the contents of its own
		blockchain.
	</p>

	<p>
		Here are some notional DACs that might well appear in the coming year
		…or decade. Naturally, their corporate names in the DAC Domain would
		end in DAC, not INC, LTD, or LLC. (Folks will want to know if they are
		dealing with a Corporation of Superhuman Integrity.) The common
		denominator is they all exploit an emerging competitive edge:
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>DACs trade on their incorruptible ability to apply transparent
			rules to secure data.</i>
	</p>

	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Reputable Monikers, DAC – Manages rights to an identity namespace.
		</li>
		<li>


			Robo Courier, DAC – A secure electronic courier service.
		</li>
		<li>


			TradeBitShares, DAC – Robotically honorable banking and brokerage
			services.
		</li>
		<li>


			Unmanned Escrow, DAC – Escrow services that conditionally transfer
			ownership rights.

		</li>
		<li>

			Virtual Ventures, DAC – A crowd-sourced venture capital firm.
		</li>
		<li>


			Autonomous Arbitrators, DAC – Incorruptible arbitration services.
		</li>
		<li>

			DAC Installers R Us, DAC – Trustworthy auto-installation of
			consensus-based DAC updates.
		</li>
		<li>


			SkyNet, DAC – A swarm of DACBOT satellites implementing a unbuggable
			new Internet.
		</li>
		<li>


			One World Government, DAC – A government that can’t ignore its own
			constitution.

		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		I’ll quit before I get carried away. The point is, changing metaphors
		opens up unlimited new possibilities. You’re not limited to just
		another altcoin. What earth-shaking, paradigm-busting DAC could you
		release into the wild?
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Bottom Line.</b> Metaphorically, the concept of a Distributed
		Autonomous Corporation is a helpful way to understand the much greater
		potential of the technology pioneered by Bitcoin. By moving from the
		metaphor of a digital currency to one of an incorruptible unmanned
		business, revolutionary new entities can be envisioned. Unlike their
		flesh and blood peers, DACs will be sovereign corporations governed
		with inhuman integrity.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b><i>And that should make all the difference.</i> </b>
	</p>
