  BitShares strives to be to business what Bitcoin is to money. 
  This ambitious goal is made possible by Satoshi Nakamoto’s 
  solution in 2008 to a problem in distributed computing that 
  had been declared impossible to solve since the 1970s. 
  However, as is always the case with new technology, the 
  language often lacks words for the new concepts associated 
  with the innovation, as we are forced to use existing words 
  in strange new ways, as our ancestors did when faced with 
  the ‘horseless carriage’ (automobile), ‘talking picture’
  (movie), or ‘information superhighway’ (Internet).
  </p>

  <p>
  As noted in the Montague Institute Review article, “IT 
  Neologisms: Necessary but Dangerous” from January 2010:To
  make sense of rapid change, we are inclined to make 
  incremental alterations to our existing world view—much 
  like adding a patch to a comfortable shirt. A good example 
  is the phrase “horseless carriage,” a kind of neologism 
  that helped people absorb the concept of a self-propelled 
  vehicle. Although they can be expedient in the short term,
  most neologisms are eventually replaced by other terms that
  more accurately reflect the new reality. In the meantime, 
  they can confuse both developers and consumers, increase 
  costs, and obscure the true nature of change.
  </p>

  <p>
  Thus, while it is true that words have meanings, it is equally 
  true that a rose by any other name is still a rose.
  </p>

  <p>
  Many words often have several very different meanings
  simultaneously, or different meanings in different contexts.
  Some words—like ‘cleave’, ‘sanction’, and ‘dust’—
  are even their own antonyms. Sometimes we invoke similes 
  and analogies. At other times, one might resort to sarcasm,
  which is stating the exact opposite of what means for dramatic
  effect. If one holds that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, 
  one might opt for sardonicism, which is stating what one means 
  but in a sarcastic tone, typically as either understatement or
  hyperbole.
  </p>


  <p>
  Most of us, who are familiar enough with Bitcoin to explain it to 
  others, know that there are no ‘coins’ to be ‘mined’, as if 
  coins were mined in the real world. Ore is mined, and coins are
  minted, which has nothing to do with how they smell or taste.
  These are similes and analogies. To fixate on their literal 
  meanings is foolish, if not disingenuous.
  </p>


  <p>

  However one describes what a piece of software does, it does what 
  it does; no more and no less, and no matter what natural language
  words one uses to describe it. If one truly wants to understand
  what Bitcoin, BitShares, Ethereum, Linux, or any other software 
  does, one must analyze the source code. Nonetheless, some 
  individuals seem to derive perverse delight in taking similes 
  and analogies literally and pretending to find controversy where 
  none exists. Whether this is playing Devil’s Advocate, impish 
  trolling, or some form of narcissistic cry for attention, it can
  lead to economic harm to the party whose words are willfully 
  misinterpreted.
  </p>


  <p>
  For example, a reasonable person recognizes “Invest in a  
  professionally maintained luxury sedan…” to be a call to buy a
  used car. If someone of ill will reported the used car dealer to  
  financial regulators for soliciting unregistered investments that 
  consistently lose value—”You said ‘invest‘!”—even if the
  dealer prevailed, he or she still would have to hire a lawyer, take 
  time out of an already busy workday to rebut the spurious claim, 
  and repair his or her reputation.
  </p>


  <p>
  In a field as young and dynamic as crypto currency, it is unsurprising 
  that we have faux controversy in abundance. Very few in the general
  public understand Bitcoin, and those who are working on Crypto 
  currency 2.0 projects like BitShares, colored coins, Ethereum, 
  Mastercoin, or Ripple might as well be engaging in wizardry, as far
  as all but the insiders are concerned. Still, that does not stop some
  wags and gadflies from imagining that they witness nefarious skullduggery
  and declare their dark fantasies and uninformed opinions to be immutable
  facts. Those on the receiving end of this often pseudonymous misquoting,
  misinterpretation, and outright lies must choose between ignoring the 
  false claims or engaging in conversation that often just digs one 
  deeper into a pit of falsehoods. (That last bit is a simile.) Neither
  option is particularly appealing. On an open forum, the choice is 
  unavoidable.

  </p>


  <p>
  This brings us to BitShares, and by extension all crypto currency 2.0 
  innovations.
  </p>


  <p>
  There are no shares in BitShares. Any references made to ‘shares’, 
 ‘investments’, ‘dividends’, ‘banks’, etc. by the principals have
  been and are analogies, intended to help the lay reader form a mental 
  image of what the software does. Such references are invocations of 
  familiar concepts presented as similes, rather than as metaphors. An 
  example of a simile is, “The USA is the 800-pound gorilla of capital 
  markets.” Clearly, the USA is not a great ape native to the 
  rainforests of Sub-Saharan Africa. It is a country, just south of 
  Canada and west of the Bahamas.
  </p>


  <p>
  To argue that the authors of the BitShares software should be subject 
  to securities regulation is as nonsensical as arguing that, because it 
  is illegal to own gorillas in most jurisdictions within the USA, the
  person using the analogy above is advocating animal endangerment. Even
  if one invoked a metaphor, such as “The USA is like an 800-pound
  gorilla…” that would be little better than saying that features of
  BitShares are like shares, like investments, like dividends, like
  banks, etc.
  </p>


  <p>
  Likewise, calls to regulate Ethereum are as nonsensical as calling for
  the regulation of C++, Java, Python, or Ruby.
  </p>


  <p>
  Granted, regulation might apply to the use of the software, but that is 
  another matter. The point here is about reading features into a brand
  name or an analogy used to explain what a piece of software does that
  simply are not there.
  </p>

  The Federal Reserve does not issue Linden Dollars. There is no gold in 
  Reddit Gold or in an American Express gold card. The US Treasury 
  Department does not operate American Express. The US Department of 
  Transportation does not operate Federal Express. The winner of a game
  of Monopoly is not guilty of violating the Sherman Act of 1890. The 
  House of Windsor does not produce Royal Crown Cola. There is no coca
  in Coca Cola. There is no anesthetic in Ethereum.
  </p>

  When Daniel Larimer coined the term ‘Decentralized Autonomous Company’ 
  (DAC), and declared Bitcoin to be the first DAC, he was using the term 
 ‘company’ as an analogy to help the lay public form a mental image.
  Similarly, when he named his software for creating subsequent DACs 
 ‘BitShares’, he meant that one could draw a cartoon depicting one’s 
  crypto-currency holdings as ‘shares‘, rather than ‘coins‘. (As a 
  side note, this is analogous to mapping the cash flows of a firm to 
  those of a government, and noting that corporate shares correspond 
  to fiat money, and that USD can be seen as shares in the US federal
  government.)
  </p>

  <p>
  In other words, Bitcoin-the-system can be viewed as a DAC, where each 
  bitcoin-the-unit represents one share in the distributed, 
  self-organizing, self-enforcing ‘company‘ that we call Bitcoin. 
  The change of analytical framework from coins to shares makes seeing 
  ways to improve Bitcoin-the-company more straightforward.
  </p>

  <p>
  For example, the primary goal of a firm—more accurately, the firm’s 
  shareholders—is to maximize profits. This is not to be confused with 
  minimizing costs or maximizing revenues. If one wants to minimize costs,
  one can reduce them to zero by shutting down. At the other extreme, if 
  one wants to maximize revenues, one ends up pushing one’s equipment 
  and employees to the breaking point. The optimal scale is the one that
  maximizes the difference between revenues and costs, which is in a kind 
  of ‘Goldilocks Zone’ between ‘too big’ and ‘too little’.
  </p>

  <p>
  When we think of Bitcoin as an issuer of coins, efficiency is a secondary
  concern. If the network slows down, just throw more silicon-&-electricity 
  at it. In fact, the Proof-of-Work used to secure the Bitcoin system 
  embraces inefficiency as a core feature. However, when we think of 
  Bitcoin as an issuer of shares, efficiency becomes one of the primary 
  concerns, and more efficient alternatives to Proof-of-Work become more desirable.
  </p>

  <p>
  One alternative is Proof-of-Stake, which secures a system by having the 
 ‘shareholders’ vote on the valid transaction ledger in proportion to their holdings.
  In this way, those who own the system secure the system without having to spend
  huge amounts of resources on doing more work than any attacker can.
  </p>


  <p>
  Of course, Bitcoin developers could replace Proof-of-Work with Proof-of-Stake, but 
  they would need the cooperation of the transaction processors, known metaphorically 
  as ‘miners’, as they control the majority of the computing power that makes up the
   Bitcoin system. In other words, seen as a company, the holders of bitcoin-the-unit 
  own non-voting shares. The miners have all of the voting power.
  </p>

  <p>
  As a payment protocol, this obviously is not a devastating problem. Otherwise, Bitcoin 
  would not exist. As a company, on the other hand, this is like having the vast majority
  of shares in circulation stripped of their voting rights, and all of the voting 
  power concentrated in the hands of a small number of parties who might not even hold
   the bitcoins longer than it takes to sell them that they receive in payment for their
  services. This situation is unusual in countries that tend to attract a lot of foreign 
  investment, like Australia, Canada, the UK, and the USA. It is much more like the large, 
  family-owned combines that one sees in the Developing World.
  </p>

  <p>
  Carrying the company analogy a bit further, the goal of maximizing the ‘equity-per-share’
  ratio replaces the goal of maintaining a constant ‘backing-per-currency-unit’ 
  ratio in a currency system. With a currency, the general tendency is to strive for a 
  stable price-per-stuff ratio. Granted, one can argue in favor of a truly deflationary 
  currency, but this continues to be a minority view, and the default is stable prices 
  for the vast majority of currency users. Shares, on the other hand, are expected to pay
  dividends, appreciate in value, or both. When we think of a DAC as a company, rather than
  as a mint, the idea of units that increase in value comes more naturally.
